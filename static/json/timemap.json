At 11 A.M. we ate our meal and before we could even finish eating the bugle sounded assembly. We threw down the mess kits with the kasha (5) and the borscht and ran to put on full battle gear, and then we fell into formation. We looked at our barracks, which appeared now, empty and deserted. A feeling of terror came upon us.\n\nMany people were gathered in the parade grounds. Jews, Christians. Civilians and military people - all came to say good-bye and to observe the departure ceremony.\n\nThen came the regiment commander with the brigade General Katrievitch. The general greeted us first, then came the military chaplain. He conducted a prayer service: he offered a prayer for the welfare of the Czar and his heir and then wished us success and good luck on our journey.\n\nThe rabbi came to see us, the Jewish soldiers. He brought with him a scroll of the Torah (6) and asked the general if he could conduct a service for us. Permission was granted. The rabbi stood near a table, put on a talis (7) and recited a few psalms. (honoten y'shuo. a mi sheberach) and that was the end our service. Then Schwartzman, the contractor, brought wine and said he wanted to drink to the general's health. And the general gave permission.\n\nFour silver goblets were brought and filled with wine. The first goblet was given to the general. The second - to our regiment commander. The third - to the commander of the 10th regiment and the fourth - to Schwartsman. The general drank to the health of His Imperial Majesty, the Czar and to the health of Her Imperial Majesty, the Czarina; then he drank to the health of the inhabitants of the town of Zhmerinke, which he said gave him so much joy. We yelled: \"Hurrah! Hurrah!\u201d the band played and they all drank the first toast. Then Schwartzman drank to the health of their Excellences. The commanders of the 9th and the 10th regiments and to the health of all the riflemen and we yelled: \"Hurrah! Hurrah\"'\n\nThen vodka was set up for the soldiers and a table of cold cuts for the whole regiment- and it made no difference whether Jew or Christian: all drank. The general was pleased with the local Jews and he thanked them for their help.\n\nA photographer came and took a picture of the whole regiment so that we would have a reminder of this day. Then Schwartzman said to us: \u201cEven though we are Jews, we are Russian subjects and we should exert every effort to fight the enemy and fight with all we've got. May God give you strength and endurance to overcome everything and to succeed wherever you go.\u201d\n\nThe band was still playing but things quieted down a little. More vodka was brought in and we drank some more and from regular drinking glasses - we were having a good time in the midst of all our troubles.\n\nThen all this ended - the regimental commander shouted: \"Shoulder arms! Forward march! \"The band played a lively, brisk march and we started marching. \n\nThe officers Started saying good-bye to their wives and children. They kissed and cried and were off to the railroad station singing Russian songs as we marched.\n\nThe whole town was following us - it felt like a funeral of the living: one was laughing, one was crying and another was sighing as he was looking at these young men going off to war.\n\nAs we arrived at the railroad station - it was packed full of people. Parents, brothers, sisters and friends were wailing - all wanted to say good-bye and to wish us a pleasant journey. The screaming and the hollering is loud enough to reach   the heavens.         Just then we heard the first bell. The officers were shouting \"into the (train) cars!\" The good-byes were said, the tears were pouring and the reminders were heard: \u201cFor God's sake, don't forget to write letters!\u201d We got into the cars - twenty soldiers to a car and as we sat down in our seats we heard the second and third bells.\n\nThe band was playing a march and all the people were waving good- bye with their hats or with their kerchiefs. The photographer took another picture.  The engineer blew the whistle and the train started moving.  Feeling sad and brokenhearted the soldiers began singing Russian songs. The singing was worse (sadder) than the crying. Some people were still waving good- bye but the train started moving and it was difficult to see now.  We could still hear shouts of \u201cFarewell! Farewell!\" Some soldiers were crying and the tears were flowing like water when they heard the shouts of farewell and each one thought to himself: \"Who knows whether we will ever see each other again, whether we will ever return and see Zhmerinke.\"\n\nWe soldiers were sitting in our train cars like chickens before the slaughter. We were in a gloomy mood like after N\u2019ilah (9) and all kinds of thoughts ran through our minds: we are going to war we will have to shoot to stab to suffer hardships by the pound - and you begin to rue the day of your birth.\n\nAs the train started to move, some soldiers were walking around and yelling: \"Come. Brothers let's drink some vodka and have a bite to eat because if you\u2019ll start brooding you\u2019ll go crazy!\" Some men were convinced of this truth and they had so much to drink that they didn't know any more what trouble they were in.\n\nOne soldier got the idea to play cards. So he gathered together a company of men and they played cards. Each one thought that he will win - but one can lose much easier than one can win. Some of the men lost so badly that they were left without a penny - and if one of them ended up owing you money, there was nothing you could do about it unless you were prepared to kill him.

Many people came running, Jews and Gentiles, and everybody was asking: \"Where are you going?\" We told everybody in secret: \"We are off to war.\" One person sighed upon hearing this. Another groaned, a third rolled his eyes and got weepy. We were already sick and tired of the public's reaction to our going to war. The first bell rang, the signal was given to get back into the train cars, our \"horse\" gave a whistle and the train was moving off. All the people were bowing to us taking off their hats and we were yelling: \"Hurrah! Hurrah!\" The shouting almost broke the train car apart.\n\nNow night was falling. We started looking around for a place to sleep. But woe! There was nothing to sleep on but the slatted coach seats and even these would not accommodate everybody. Just imagine! Twenty men to a car and there was nothing to put under you for bedding. What was a soldier to do? He had a soldier's coat, a \"shinel\" (10) - that's all. As he lay down to sleep the soldier put his shinel under him. And he also covered himself with his shinel and put it under his head as well. So, it would seem that the soldier slept well!

When our ship got the message, she proceeded into the harbor and docked at the pier.\n\nIt was now 9:00 in the morning and a huge crowd was present to welcome us. An orchestra played and the orchestra aboard the ship played as well. There was big noise and commotion, which we haven't heard and or seen since we left Vladivostok. We were finally home!\n\nA photographer came aboard and began to take pictures of us in various places on the boat so as to cover our return and show the boat which brought us back home. This took about an hour and gradually, the crowd on the dock began to disperse and the music subsided. We began to wonder what would happen next and when we would be allowed to disembark. \n\nWhile we were waiting for orders rumors began to spread about what might happen to us next. Some said that we'd probably have to undergo a thorough medical troops returning from the war. But what happened next was not exactly what the examination. Feodosiya was the military headquarters and assembly point for all rumors were all about. When our orders finally came to leave the boat we were extremely happy and thankful to the good Lord that he was no longer having us sail in the \"seven seas\" and that we were alive and well. \n\nFirst our belongings were put on wagons and we were taken of all places to the customs office for an inspection. Who would have expected that of all things, the first thing would be an examination of our belongings to see if we didn't bring in \"contraband\" from our foreign pursuits?\n\nI personally had nothing of value or importance to declare nor did any of my fellow soldiers.\tThe whole thing was a real farce and we certainly weren't afraid of the consequences of the customs inspection. The inspection was finally over and we were taken to the bath- house. This was really a treat as we had not taken a real bath for ages. We were very happy with the turn of events after the customs inspection and all.\n\nWe felt like newborn babies, fresh and clean and really good about ourselves. We went back to the assembly point when the order was given and we all broke out in song as we were marching along. Our regimental orchestra went back into action and suddenly we felt like soldiers again, but of a happy sort. Not the kind of soldiers who go to war, but the kind that return from war, back to peace and life. At first we didn\u2019t know where we were heading. We knew that Zhmerinka was our final destination, it was our home base, but how soon we'd be on our way there was still\nUnknown to most of us soldiers.\n\nAt the assembly point, an orchestra was playing again and we were given food fit for a king. \"Fonie\" was generous and we were all fed as follows: white bread (it tasted like challa) and a big portion of halva (34) which we hadn't seen in ages.  To finish it off. We also each received a glass of vodka - a royal treat.\n\nFinally, the time came for us to leave Feodosiya, which after all we had suffered through, gave us such a nice welcome. We were put on wagons with our gear, which was quite a luxury, and off to the railway station to board the train back to Zhmerinka, at last.\n\nIn all the commotion, while boarding the train, we noticed something unusual. A young Chinese boy, dressed in Russian military garb was being closely watched by an officer. As we found out earlier, the officer brought the boy from Manchuria as a \"trophy\", a memento of his adventures in a foreign land. The Russian soldiers followed him with their eyes in disbelief. Some threw coins at him, perhaps to see if he would dance. The more daring ones just   plain poked   fun at him and asked him to reveal his braid, which was neatly covered beneath his cap.\n\nAfter this bit of \"fun and games\", we were assigned our seats on the train. The train was very crowded. And there were more of us than there were seats. We had to make the best of it in our assigned car.  Soon we began to sweat from the heat and crowded conditions. Our neat bath and fresh clothing were a thing of the past. A lengthy train trip was about to begin.\n", "title": "Feodosiya", "media": "", "null": ["", "", ""], "source_url": "http://www.britannica.com/place/Feodosiya", "source": "Britannica", "place": "", "location": "45.032903, 35.377084"},

The orchestra played and the crowd was noisy and jovial. There were military and civilian people among the multitude. Friends and family came to see who returned from the war, in the hope of finding some of their own. We mingle with the people and they ask us many questions as they are very curious about our experiences. They asked us where we were corning from and where we were going and also did we know such and such a person.\n\nEventually, our socializing came to an abrupt end. An order and call for assembly came. We fell into line. The good news was that we were going to be fed and rumor had it that it would be a good supper, something that we hadn't had since the day we left Feodosiya.\n\nMusic played, and we were led marching like a \"kale zu der khupe (36)\" The crowd probably thought that we were led to perform an important duty, and deserved the biggest of honors.        We were fed a good, hot meal at the local army barracks. Soon after, we were led back to the train station to board our train and continue our journey.\n\nAt the train station, there was still a crowd, though somewhat smaller than before. People were still asking questions about our past experience. Some of us were tiring of answering the same questions. Many told of unheard stories of \"bravery\" and \"courage\" just to impress their listeners and thus to get rid of them. The people were left to mull over what they had been told.\n\nTired as we were by then we were grateful when the order came to return to our train compartment. It became dark suddenly and the crowd started to disperse. Our orchestra started to play again, but we were too tired and mentally drained to appreciate the ongoing merriment.

Luckily for us, it did not affect the movement of our train - we were not impeded in any way. Also, to our delight, we found out that Wapniarka was our last stop before Zhmerinka, our final and last stop - - end of our troubles and travels!\n\nThe latest news was like a dream come true. We'll finally return to our home base, but we dared not dream yet of our near homes, the places where we had our humble beginnings in the Czar's army. The place from which we started on our long and   hard campaign to Manchuria, half way across the world. With God's help, all this would be behind us, and we were returning from the war unharmed, something many of us didn't expect or believe would happen.\n\nWe all became very excited and elated. We couldn't sit still in our seats and kept a constant look out for Zhmerinka. It was night and pitch dark outside. We couldn't see much out of our train compartment windows, and it also started to rain. The rain fell harder and harder, and we could hear it on the roof of the train. Water started to gush through cracks in the windows.\tRain was also seeping in through the doors and the ceiling. As this downpour continued, so did our excitement and anticipation. Even though we had no one in our train compartment who knew exactly where we were or how far we were from Zhrnerinka, we knew and sensed that we were quite near our destination.\n", "title": "Wapniarka", "media": "", "null": ["", "", ""], "source_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapniarka", "source": "Wikipedia", "place": "Vapniarka", "location": "48.534102, 28.741219"},

It was the middle of the night and the train station was flooded with light like daylight. In spite of the rain.  There was an orchestra present and a big crowd. The size of which we had not seen   before. It looked like the whole of Zhmerinka was there to welcome us. As soon as the train stopped, we were anxiously awaiting the order to get off the train and fall in line for a march back to our home base.\n\nBut our commanding officers didn't seem to be in a hurry. They must have had better accommodations on the train than we had, and probably weren't anxious to start marching in the pouring rain. The crowd outside found some protection underneath the extended roof of the small station and waited patiently. As if to answer our prayers, the rain suddenly abated. The orchestra started to play some cheerful marches and our officers finally \"got their act together\" and ordered us out of the train. Not only that, but we got a fifteen minute time off to mix with the crowd and find friends or relatives. The people in the crowd were as anxious to see us as we were to see them. Personally, I did not expect members of my family to come see me all the way from Warsaw. I was happy, though for I was getting physically closer to my real home, and the main thing was that I was alive and well. The reception we received was incredible. We were hugged and kissed by so many people we didn't know. Men were wiping their eyes with big handkerchiefs, women were sobbing aloud, unabashedly. Some of the soldiers found their relatives, and their joy was the greatest. The whole scene was bedlam - and for good reason.        How often does a trainload of soldiers arrive from the war? We had all been away a very long time and had experienced all kinds of hardships, not to mention the danger of being killed. The thought of those who hadn't returned alive, sort of flashed through my mind.  But, at the moment, the joy and happiness experienced by all overwhelmed that kind of thought.\n\nFinally, after what seemed to be only a short reprieve, we were given our marching orders. We all fell in line, carrying our belongings on our backs, ready to return to our home barracks. As the music played ahead of us, and some of the crowd followed us, we marched back to the Zhmerinka home base. We trudged through the deep mud, after the rain. Wet and tired as we were with heavy loads on our backs (heavier due to being wet), we used our elation to help us overcome our fatigue. This made our steps lighter and our determination to reach our barracks even stronger.\n\nEven though we were exhausted, we laughed on the inside and thanked the Lord for our good fortune. We had made it alive and returned home from a cruel war, and a possibly sad fate - back home to Russia and Zhmerinke. At last, in the distance, we could see the lights of the barracks beckoning to us and we felt like we were in Paradise!", "title": "Zhmerinka", "media": "http://photos.wikimapia.org/p/00/02/53/86/28_big.jpg", "null": ["", "", ""], "source_url": "http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0021_0_21531.html", "source": "Jewish Virtual Library", "place": "Zhmerynka", "location": "49.040396, 28.111535"}
