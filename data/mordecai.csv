Zhmerinka,7/7/1899,,"We worked all day carrying the army gear, which was needed for the journey, to the railroad depot. At 11 A.M. we ate our meal and before we could even finish eating the bugle sounded assembly. We threw down the mess kits with the kasha (5) and the borscht and ran to put on full battle gear, and then we fell into formation. We looked at our barracks, which appeared now, empty and deserted. A feeling of terror came upon us.

Many people were gathered in the parade grounds. Jews, Christians. Civilians and military people - all came to say good-bye and to observe the departure ceremony.

Then came the regiment commander with the brigade General Katrievitch. The general greeted us first, then came the military chaplain. He conducted a prayer service: he offered a prayer for the welfare of the Czar and his heir and then wished us success and good luck on our journey.

The rabbi came to see us, the Jewish soldiers. He brought with him a scroll of the Torah (6) and asked the general if he could conduct a service for us. Permission was granted. The rabbi stood near a table, put on a talis (7) and recited a few psalms. (honoten y'shuo. a mi sheberach) and that was the end our service. Then Schwartzman, the contractor, brought wine and said he wanted to drink to the general's health. And the general gave permission.

Four silver goblets were brought and filled with wine. The first goblet was given to the general. The second - to our regiment commander. The third - to the commander of the 10th regiment and the fourth - to Schwartsman. The general drank to the health of His Imperial Majesty, the Czar and to the health of Her Imperial Majesty, the Czarina; then he drank to the health of the inhabitants of the town of Zhmerinke, which he said gave him so much joy. We yelled: ""Hurrah! Hurrah!” the band played and they all drank the first toast. Then Schwartzman drank to the health of their Excellences. The commanders of the 9th and the 10th regiments and to the health of all the riflemen and we yelled: ""Hurrah! Hurrah""'

Then vodka was set up for the soldiers and a table of cold cuts for the whole regiment- and it made no difference whether Jew or Christian: all drank. The general was pleased with the local Jews and he thanked them for their help.

A photographer came and took a picture of the whole regiment so that we would have a reminder of this day. Then Schwartzman said to us: “Even though we are Jews, we are Russian subjects and we should exert every effort to fight the enemy and fight with all we've got. May God give you strength and endurance to overcome everything and to succeed wherever you go.”

The band was still playing but things quieted down a little. More vodka was brought in and we drank some more and from regular drinking glasses - we were having a good time in the midst of all our troubles.

Then all this ended - the regimental commander shouted: ""Shoulder arms! Forward march! ""The band played a lively, brisk march and we started marching. 

The officers Started saying good-bye to their wives and children. They kissed and cried and were off to the railroad station singing Russian songs as we marched.

The whole town was following us - it felt like a funeral of the living: one was laughing, one was crying and another was sighing as he was looking at these young men going off to war.

As we arrived at the railroad station - it was packed full of people. Parents, brothers, sisters and friends were wailing - all wanted to say good-bye and to wish us a pleasant journey. The screaming and the hollering is loud enough to reach   the heavens.         Just then we heard the first bell. The officers were shouting ""into the (train) cars!"" The good-byes were said, the tears were pouring and the reminders were heard: “For God's sake, don't forget to write letters!” We got into the cars - twenty soldiers to a car and as we sat down in our seats we heard the second and third bells.

The band was playing a march and all the people were waving good- bye with their hats or with their kerchiefs. The photographer took another picture.  The engineer blew the whistle and the train started moving.  Feeling sad and brokenhearted the soldiers began singing Russian songs. The singing was worse (sadder) than the crying. Some people were still waving good- bye but the train started moving and it was difficult to see now.  We could still hear shouts of “Farewell! Farewell!"" Some soldiers were crying and the tears were flowing like water when they heard the shouts of farewell and each one thought to himself: ""Who knows whether we will ever see each other again, whether we will ever return and see Zhmerinke.""

We soldiers were sitting in our train cars like chickens before the slaughter. We were in a gloomy mood like after N’ilah (9) and all kinds of thoughts ran through our minds: we are going to war we will have to shoot to stab to suffer hardships by the pound - and you begin to rue the day of your birth.

As the train started to move, some soldiers were walking around and yelling: ""Come. Brothers let's drink some vodka and have a bite to eat because if you’ll start brooding you’ll go crazy!"" Some men were convinced of this truth and they had so much to drink that they didn't know any more what trouble they were in.

One soldier got the idea to play cards. So he gathered together a company of men and they played cards. Each one thought that he will win - but one can lose much easier than one can win. Some of the men lost so badly that they were left without a penny - and if one of them ended up owing you money, there was nothing you could do about it unless you were prepared to kill him.

Vinitse,7/7/1899,,"Meanwhile, the train stopped at the railroad station at Vinitse. We were received nicely. The local band was playing and the sign was given to get out of the train cars and then we just stood around for twenty minutes. Many people came running, Jews and Gentiles, and everybody was asking: ""Where are you going?"" We told everybody in secret: ""We are off to war."" One person sighed upon hearing this. Another groaned, a third rolled his eyes and got weepy. We were already sick and tired of the public's reaction to our going to war. The first bell rang, the signal was given to get back into the train cars, our ""horse"" gave a whistle and the train was moving off. All the people were bowing to us taking off their hats and we were yelling: ""Hurrah! Hurrah!"" The shouting almost broke the train car apart.

Now night was falling. We started looking around for a place to sleep. But woe! There was nothing to sleep on but the slatted coach seats and even these would not accommodate everybody. Just imagine! Twenty men to a car and there was nothing to put under you for bedding. What was a soldier to do? He had a soldier's coat, a ""shinel"" (10) - that's all. As he lay down to sleep the soldier put his shinel under him. And he also covered himself with his shinel and put it under his head as well. So, it would seem that the soldier slept well! When we got up in the morning there was not a bone in our bodies that didn't ache because of these ""soft"" beds that we were sleeping in. When we considered how long we will have to keep on rolling around on these ""soft"" beds and continue going through all kinds of hardships - it made us feel even worse.

Kozatin,7/8/1899,,"At 11 o'clock in the morning  we arrived at the railroad station at Kozatin . Suddenly we heard shouting, which was coming from the outside: “Schwartzman! Greenstein! Averman! Pinchas! Shlomo!"" and so on. It turned out that these soldiers had family here. They kissed and greeted each other with great pleasure. The relatives did not know that we were on our way to war. As soon as we told them the mood changed and the groaning started.

As soon as we would arrive at a railroad station the soldiers would start looking for warm tea; one would run with a small container, another with a teapot. At each stop on our way, tea had been provided for us at government expense. However. Drinking tea is not enough - you have to eat too. The soldiers would run to buy bread, rolls, sugar, cheese, eggs, salami and other things like that. One soldier would buy thing. And pay for his purchase, another...

Kursk,7/9/1899,,"At 10 o'clock at night we arrived in KURSK. Kursk is a very big city. The train was delayed and we just waited for two hours. As we got out of our train cars a group of soldiers came up to us. We asked them whether there was any news. They said that everything was quiet around here and they hadn't heard any news.

We were given permission to go into the city. Kursk is a very big city but very few Jews were to be found here.

As we got into the city in the dark of night, a whole bright world opened up before us. We went shopping for food and we did really well: we bought rolls, bread, sugar tea, salami, cigarette paper and things like that which a soldier needs. However. One soldier paid for his purchase and five did not. The merchants made a profit anyway. They knew that we were going to war and they probably figured:"" Let them go!"" They also knew that we were the first brigades coming and they will do a lot more business.

At 10 o'clock at night we left Kursk . A big crowd came to see us off at the railroad station and everybody was curious to find out where we were going. The band played as we got into our train cars. The third bell rang, the locomotive gave a whistle and we were moving away. The people were bowing to us and we were singing songs and shouting: ""Hurrah! Hurrah!""

An unusual think happened as we were leaving Kursk. Several soldiers were left behind because they got drunk - dead drunk - and we didn't know where to find them. Total Population: 75,721 Russian Orthodox Population: 71,648 Jewish Population: Unlisted in overview of the 1897 Imperial Census

Voronezh,7/11/1899,,"July 11th we arrived in VORONEZH. Here they gave us a whole day’s furlough. We went into town in groups. We went bathing in the river and also did our laundry. Our general arrived. told us to gather around him and spoke to us: ""Fellows. As you know these are rough times for the military, particularly when we are in transit. You may lose your life for any breach of discipline. Well, then - don't do anything foolish!"" And we responded: We won't do such things anymore!""

A lot of people gathered around. The band was playing, some soldiers were dancing, some were singing, some were fooling around and some were wrestling. People were wondering how soldiers who were under such stress were able to entertain themselves. Now some of the people recalled that they had relatives in the army and as they began to think about the difficulties these relatives may be going through, they wept bitterly.

At 8 o'clock in the evening we got back into our train cars and - off we went. Total Population: 80,599 Jewish Population: 1708 Russian Orthodox Population: 76,689",,"51.689312, 39.191533",Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronezh#History,,,,,

We traveled all night and all day and passed by many small stations. While we were traveling we hadn't had any dinner and felt barely alive. Although some men were sleeping, some were playing cards. One was singing and another was playing his accordion. Some men were even dancing.  But while some soldiers were dancing our stomachs were doing their own dance.

Another shouted: ""It is still night - I won't eat"" One soldier was cursing his life, another was laughing. But all this cursing and yelling was useless because if we didn't eat now, it was possible that we could go another twenty-four hours without a meal. In any case, because I  had  to  gobble  down  this  meal  the  food  stuck  in  my throat. We did not even have a chance to finish this dinner when the order was given to get back into the train cars and we were on our way.

Penza,7/14/1899,,"On July 14th we arrived in a big city called PENZA. A lot of people gathered around when we arrived. We went to eat dinner.

In the midst of all this. an old man, holding an alms box, came up to me and offered to pray in church for my successful return if I would put five kopecks in his alms box. My reply to him was: ""You came with nothing - you'll leave with nothing. And I thought to myself: ""Why don't you give me five kopecks and then I will pray for you- which you leave me alone and get lost."" We didn't think much of this alms-giving business.

Meanwhile, a train arrived (from the opposite direction) carrying Russian settlers who had to flee for their lives. These people were civilian settlers who lived near Manchuria.

When the war started the Chinese attacked them robbed them and burned their homes. They had to run for their lives and now they were returning to Russia. They were poor and looked threadbare and it was a pity to look at them. They were traveling at government expense just like soldiers: fifty people in one freight car, including women and children. They were receiving (from the government) half a pound of meat and a pound of bread for a mere three kopecks and borscht and tea for free.

Samara,7/15/1899,,"At noon we arrived in Samara - also a very big day.  We had our meal near the railroad station and then each one of us received two glasses of beer.  We didn't know where this beer came from or who had donated it, Later we learned that there was a wealthy brewer here in Samara and that he treated the entire brigade to free beer because we were going to war. That was very nice and I wouldn't have minded having some beer every day - and some food as well.

After we had the beer we went into the city. The city of Samara is very big but very few Jews could be found here. Those who lived here were all tradesmen who received residence-permits because deep inside Russia (outside the pale of settlement) Jews were not allowed to live unless they received special permission. And when you met one of these Jews, you would never recognize that it was a Jew because they had become thoroughly Christianized, spoke only Russian and knew very little of their Jewish heritage.

Omsk,7/23/1899,7/23/1899,"On  July  23rd  we  arrived  in  Omsk  in  the  Malinovsky region.

As we were approaching the railroad station a miracle occurred: We had to cross over a long bridge a couple of miles before we got to the railroad station. Some Kirgiz men wanted to blow up the bridge just as our train was moving across it. They placed dynamite charges under the railroad ties. Had this dynamite exploded we would have perished - they would not have been able to find even a shred of our remnants. However, this business was discovered in time and these men were caught and sent away (where they deserved to be) in chains. An order was issued immediately that a man should be placed every couple of miles to guard the railroad and that soldiers should guard every bridge.

Omsk is a very big city in Siberia and people could be found here from all over Russia and Poland - but all were exiles. Nevertheless. They were doing rather well here. They were wealthy and were doing big business.

Here in Omsk we celebrated a regimental holiday. We fell in formation and our general came with the chaplain who conducted a prayer service. As we stood there a photographer came and took a picture of the whole regiment. We had some vodka and ate dinner.

We went into the city and found many Jews who were living here but came from Warsaw. They were exiled to Omsk and had been living here a long time. Many soldiers who came from Warsaw themselves found relatives here who they had never heard of before: uncles, aunts, brothers-in-law and also close friends.         They received the soldiers with respect and gave them food and money. What a pity that no relative of mine could be found here who would give me some money - but what could I do? There was none.

We saw fields which had been sown with all kinds of good things and also vineyards which the Chinese left behind as they fled when the battle began.

They are dark-skinned people who wear braids - whether man or woman, they all wear braids.

There are plenty of wealthy Chinese here. When the war started they converted to the Russian Orthodox faith and they were doing real well in their businesses.

The dress of the Chinese is old-fashioned. They don't wear shirts and long johns (underwear) but they wear two pairs of trousers. One pair is long and the other, a short pair is worn over the long pair. It looks like a shield or some kind of armor. The sleeves are short. They all smoke long pipes - young and old. You don't see any women among them because they are afraid to show their face.

About four o'clock we boarded our ship and we continued our journey on water.

Our daily routine is crazy now: we travel all day until 9 o'clock at night, then we pull up in the shore. We dig deep pits and put big kettles into them and cook our dinner all night long. We are fed our dinner at 6 o'clock in the morning, we embark and then we continue our journey. This is how it is done every night. There is nothing around here except forests. And there is nothing in the forests except wood which our ship takes on (to fire the steam engines). When we stop we put up tents and we sleep on the bare ground. The nights are already cool. We sleep through the night and at 5 o'clock in the morning they wake us and feed us our dinner. We eat and we continue our journey. We live a crazy life on this trip.

They didn't kill him right away but they tortured him; they cut off his ear and his hand or his leg. Later that day they killed him. They beheaded him and then put a stick in the torso and carried it around the city. Because of that incident the war started and the Chinese began shooting at Blagoveshchensk.

Here in Blagoveshchensk were stationed reservists who responded to the Chinese attack and the war began. They laid siege to the Chinese city until they captured it and burned it down. Many Chinese were killed but some managed to flee for their lives. Here in Blagoveshchensk too lived many Chinese, about 4000. Some of them fled and the rest were rounded up and tied together by their braids then they were led to the water (river) and told to go across.

Fen Dzian,9/26/1899,,We left the city and marched 40 viorst (20) to the bank of the river. We embarked and traveled a few viorst by boat. We got off the boat and then marched two days on foot. We came to a city called Fen Dziah. The interpreter was sent ahead to inquire whether they will surrender peacefully or whether we will have to fight and bum down the city. They got scared and threw open all the gates of the city and gave us the keys to the city. We proceeded with the search for weapons as we did in the other city. All the weapons we could find were confiscated.,,,,,,,,,
San Dzian,9/26/1899,12/17/1899,"We entered the town - it was deserted, not even a dog was to be seen. When the Chinese heard that soldiers were coming they fled with their wives and children and left all their property unattended.

The elder of the town remained and he showed us the fort where Chinese soldiers had been stationed but they fled.

We entered the fort. We have to settle down here so we immediately started working like horses. Everything needed fixing. Chinese houses have no window panes and no ovens.  They have empty rooms and holes in the walls and here winter is coming. We started fixing things up. We need a kitchen to cook food and an oven to bake bread and quarters with window panes. However, there are no window panes to be had. That is not the Chinese style.         We had to make windows their style that is paper smeared with oil.  We worked eight hours a day. Everything was fixed up in the best way possible. Even dogs may stay here now not just soldiers. Anyway, it is nice and warm except that you can choke from the smoke. First of all they told us to bring in all the things we would need.        We bought flour and we had our provisions brought in and we were all settled in here.

Then our ""boss"" arrived, the brigade general Kotnievitch. We all jumped in parade formation and he reviewed each of us carefully and said: ""see to it that you fix yourself up because you look poorly. We will spend the winter here and then we will go back to Russia, to our old place.""        We were very happy to hear this news - it really refreshed each one of us.

The 17th of December we looked up and here was our exchange unit. We got dressed and moved out on foot to Fen Dziah. As we were marching we thanked God that we survived the first round of Hell.",,,,,,,,,

Niklosk,1/7/1900,,"On Jan. 7 we arrived in Nikolsk. We disembarked from the train and a new world greeted us. We can now see white faces for up to now we have only seen the dark­ skinned Chinese. Many of us lifted our hands to the Living God that He helped us in our needs and troubles without end and protected us from all evil. And we prayed for continued help that we should not have to face again the evil, dark-as-the-devil Chinese with their long braids.

We arrive at the railroad station in Nikolsk as the music is playing. We disembark from the train. We were happy to be finished with Manchuria where we could have gotten killed.  We were delighted to see a Russian city again in front of us.  Then as we look around we see people dark faced as the    Chinese.	They are dressed from head to toe in white and are wearing fedora style hats. At first we thought that they were ghosts, but ghosts don't wear fedoras. We asked around what kind of animal this was and we were told that these were Koreans.

Nikolsk is a large Russian city.   Here you find people of various nationalities. Russians, Poles, Chinese and Koreans.  You  even  find  a couple  of  Jews  here and the  dark-faced  Japanese  who  are  all  dressed  in  European  clothes.

Vladivostok,3/5/1901,3/5/1901,"Vladivostock is an important sea-port and many large ships are waiting here to loaded or unloaded.

As we got off the train we were all very happy that we were about to leave for Russia. We stacked up our rifles and busied ourselves removing our gear from the baggage cars. We were taking home several flags as well as a few Chinese artillery pieces, rifles, swords and a small Chinese boy. These things were to serve as our remembrances of China.

Everything was taken out of the train, laid down on the ground and then was loaded onto the ship.
A Chinese baron was traveling with us. We were also carrying a load of long Chinese pipes.

When everything was loaded we went to the baths. After a good wash we boarded the boat. So ended the march in Manchuria. We thanked God that we overcame everything thus far and so far from home - and now we have arrived at this point.

Nagasaki,3/9/1901,3/12/1901,"After sailing for three days we arrive at an island in the Sea of Japan. On the 9th of March at 5:00 in the afternoon, we enter the port city of Nagasaki. After the ship has docked at the pier a Japanese inspection crew boards us. They are to inspect both cargo and passengers.	As it turns out, it's a mere formality and they depart as soon as they arrived. There are ships from many countries anchored at the Port of Nagasaki; we see flags from various nations - American. English. French and Japanese.

Suddenly, a flotilla of small boats approaches our vessel. They are packed full of goods for sale; we can buy anything imaginable. All kinds of food stuff, baked goods, citrus fruit, cigarettes and soft drinks. They also have gold and silver jewelry. The desire to purchase something is very strong but most of us have little or no money, so we have to satisfy ourselves with just enjoying the sight. Some passengers got into a fist fight with the vendors after not being able to pay for their purchase.	One person got beat up to serve as an example for others, not to take merchandise   for which he was not able to pay. The cheapest of all goods was tea 25 to 30 kopeks a pound where as in Russia, it would cost 2 or even 3 Rubles,

Each day for three days, the little boats kept coming and the bartering went on. Everything that one's heart desired was for sale. Clothing especially, was very inexpensive. Things such as shirts, pants, socks, etc.

Finally, our boat loads up with fuel (coal), water, food and other supplies and on March 12th, in the morning, we leave Nagasaki. Our destination - Singapore.

Soon we notice a drastic change in the weather. It's getting very hot and we feel the heat increasing as the day progresses. We receive orders to don our white outfits – pants, shirts and white cap. These are supposed to protect us from the sun and heat and were especially made for us in Nikolsk. When we look at ourselves and each other, we can't help but laugh, because we look like the walking dead!

We sail on and see nothing but endless seas, blue sky and a hot sun. Occasionally, we pass another boat or small island, and then again, the same monotony.

The heat becomes almost unbearable.	Our new clothing is getting wet and heavy, as we sweat profusely. Had it not been for our sense of feeling ashamed, we would have walked about naked!

Our boat begins to rock back and forth and from side to side. A motion disagreeable to most of us and we begin another bout with sea sickness.  We are trying to stay on deck since sea sickness below deck is an even worse experience. But there is little or no room for everybody, and it's impossible to find a shady spot to be protected from the punishing sun rays.

Every other day is laundry day. We have to do it ourselves and the only water we can use is salt water.	We find the salt water needs more soap to make suds and that presents a problem, as well. We have to do the best we can under the circumstances and hopefully our soap supply will outlast our dirt.

Singapore,3/20/1901,3/21/1901,"These were the conditions and circumstances under which we sailed until the 20th of March, the day we finally reached Singapore.

Singapore is a large city in lndo-China and it's owned by England. The population here is a mixture of various races: Hindus. Chinese. Malayans and Arabs. The complexion of most is very dark and the only white feature outstanding is their teeth which shimmer with brightness.

To our surprise, we also found some Jews, which at first made us happy. But then, to our chagrin, we realized that they didn't want to admit their Jewishness and turned away from us.

It was Passover time and we were very happy when we saw other fellow Jews. Who could help but recognize our brethren when the distinctive kugl (28) on their faces was a sure giveaway?

We'll have to celebrate Passover on the boat as best as we possibly can. ""Maror"" is plentiful. Our lives and fate are full of bitterness. ""Saltwater” - there's plenty of it; we are surrounded by a salty sea. We are even able to obtain eggs, thanks to the local vendors. The only thing we can't get is ""Matzos."" Had we been able to obtain that, we could really have had a great Passover celebration. But there's no use in bemoaning our sad circumstances. We are lucky to be alive and well and we are on our way home - thank the almighty God.

We are still decked in Singapore Harbor, but are not permitted to visit the city. Small boats with goods for sale keep on arriving and luckily, we are able to purchase some ""goodies"" using Russian money.

For 5 kopecks, we can buy a pineapple as big as a human head. The biggest surprise food is the coconut, which we have never seen, let alone eaten before. It was also very inexpensive. The coconut is not a fruit which is easily opened, inexperienced as we were at this task. But finally, when we managed to pierce through its hard shell, we found a white milky substance which was as sweet as sugar and tasted delicious. There was a soft creamy paste inside which was delicious as well.

The same day, after supper, we were told that we would be allowed to visit the city of Singapore. I was one of the first ones to report. But they wouldn’t let us go on our own. Soon we found out the reason for the restriction. There were apparently desertions in the past and Fonie (29) is afraid of future escapes.

Finally, after a lot of thinking and organizing we are allowed to march ashore in small groups, headed by officers and non-commissioned personnel.

We stroll aimlessly through the city streets and view everything with great delight. We see enormous buildings, lots of shops stocked with various goods, and a throng of people buzzing like bees. Our feet are beginning to feel sore. Finally, around midnight, we are escorted back to our ship and fall asleep right away, as we were all exhausted.

Colombo,3/26/1901,,"We survived the storm though and on the 26th of March we arrive at the city of Colombo in Ceylon which is a British colony. There are many boats in the harbor and we see flags of many countries such as American, British, French, Chinese and Japanese. The people here are different as well.	Some are white but many are black as soot. Their teeth though, are extremely white and shimmer like crystal.

Suddenly, our attention is drawn to a little wooden raft with about six people on it. For a penny, they'll sing a song. For some small change, they'll sing-and clap hands and perform various other tricks. Some of the ship's officers decide to have some fun. They invite the performers to come on board, all the way to the upper deck.  
From there, the officers toss some money into the sea and tell the poor souls to jump after it. We look at the spectacle and fear for the lives of the local performers.  They're sure to get killed or drown if they jump. Is it worthwhile to risk one’s life for a few pennies? Will they jump? We wait to see what will happen. For a moment, they hesitate but then, they suddenly seem to gather strength and leap from the upper deck - about three stories high - to the bottom of the sea to retrieve the money.

We are all speechless and watch in horror over what has happened. Surely, they won’t survive.

But, after a few minutes, they all emerge safe and sound. They signal with their hands that they have accomplished their task get back on their raft and wave goodbye to us all. We feel greatly relieved and look upon what happened as a good omen. Our boat remained in Colombo for a while longer. This time in addition to our regular supplies of coal, water and food we also get all kinds of goods to be taken to Odessa, our final destination.

Perim Island,4/5/1901,,"On the 4th of April an event occurred which gave us quite a shock. One of our officers died suddenly. Luckily for him, we were not far from our next port of call - Perim. We arrived at Perim at 9 in the morning , the following day. Perim was actually a small island at the southern entrance of the Red Sea and it was a British colony. Sadly, Perim was destined to be the final resting place for the poor officer.

On a small boat, accompanied by an honor guard of riflemen, the officer's body was taken to the Perim Island. There, as we were told later, the officer was given his final rites, according to full military honor with pomp and ceremony.

None of the members of my company knew the officer nor did any of us have any particular love for an officer yet we all felt sad. We felt sad because this officer had managed to survive the war and was on his way home, and here, suddenly, he is buried in a strange land, far away from his home and family. The only thing we had to be grateful for was that he was not thrown into the water - that would have been a cruel fate - to be eaten by fish in the ocean.

Seuz City,4/10/1901,,"On a quiet morning, April 10th, we arrived at Suez city, a big port at the southern tip of the Suez Canal. It looks like the city is surrounded by water on all sides. It looked like the boat was gliding through the city street.        We couldn't help but admire the beautiful buildings and the well-manicured gardens that we saw. And. as we marveled at everything before our eyes I thought it was a paradise. The people were all well and colorfully dressed. We saw Britons in their European garb and Arabs and Turks in their colorful robes. Everybody was very friendly and welcomed our arrival. Some were waving their hats in a welcoming greeting, others waved handkerchiefs.        We passed by a French vessel and. as our band started to play a cheerful tune, we proceeded to holler on top of our voices: ""Hurrah, hurrah!"" as is customary when saluting a friendly nation.

The French and our Czar are now on friendly terms, thus the reason for the big commotion. The French vessel did not carry an orchestra with them, but the crew on board still managed to greet us warmly. In the meantime, out boat had to dock and as it turned out, we were supposed to wait for a pilot boat which would guide us through the Suez Canal to Port Said.

When the pilot boat arrived, it was already dark. But the pilot boat is equipped with electrical lights which cast a strong light upon the water for hundreds of feet ahead. Again we were stunned at this kind of a modem, wonderful achievement.

Thus our journey began through the Suez Canal. At first we go through and past the city of Suez itself.   Even  at night  we  are  able  to  see that  the  city  is very  big,  and  the canal  is  like  a  street  cutting  through  it.   It was pitch dark when we were sailing through the canal.  but  the  strong  lights  of  the  pilot  boat  illuminated  our  way beautifully   - it  almost  looked  like  daylight  was  in  front  of  us.   The  canal  is very narrow  and  when  another  boat  approaches  from  the  opposite  direction, one  has to stop to  allow  room  for  the  other  to pass.	That  is the  only way  the  boats  can  navigate their  passage  through  the  canal  in  both  directions. It took us a whole night to sail through the canal and the following day, April 11th, we arrived at Port Said.",,"29.968215, 32.548402",Ask Aladdin,http://www.ask-aladdin.com/Egypt_cities/Suez.html,,,,,
Port Said,4/11/1901,,"The city and the canal used to belong to France, but now belong to England. Two important people were associated with the construction of the canal, a Frenchman (Ferdinand de Leseps) and a Turk (Said Pasha - Turkish Viceroy to Egypt). A monument in their honor has been erected near  the  canal  and  their  images  are  right there   for all  to  see,  pointing  their  hands  toward  the waterway.	It took many years   to build the canal and it cost “buckets of money."" Before  the  canal's  existence  it  would take  an  extra  month  to  make  the  trip  from  Asia  to  Africa to  the  Mediterranean. Now it only takes a day and it costs 1.000 Rubles. Of course, without money, no ship is allowed through the canal.

Port Said is a big harbor and a city with an international population. British, French, Greek, Turkish, Arabic and even Jewish people lived there. The Jewish people, though, speak Arabic or ""Loshn Koidesh (30)"" and do not speak ""jargon (31)."" Most Jews we encountered are dressed like the local populace. They are mostly merchants, and they came aboard offering goods for sale. Things like hand-made rugs and jewelry. They are fluent in English. French. Russian, but not Yiddish. We asked them if there were many Jewish people in Port Said and their answer was about 50 families who originally were exiled generations ago from the Holy Land and found refuge in Egypt.

Egypt was truly not far from the Holy Land. As we departed Port Said, somebody pointed out to us and at a distance, we could distinguish the contours of Mount Sinai where our forefathers received the Holy Torah. In addition, we could also see the location where Moses and the children of Israel crossed the Red Sea on their way to the Promised Land.

Dardanelles,4/13/1901,,"On April 12th, a strong rain accompanied by strong winds hit our ship again.	It was something very terrifying, and I was sure that we'd be lost forever. It's impossible to gain a secure foothold anywhere on board. The ship was tossed around like a mere toy, and people were falling over each other in a futile attempt to stay in one place.

Some were keeling over, others complained about tremendous headaches; others were just too exhausted and were suffering in silence. The Mediterranean was supposed to be a ""quiet"" sea but we sure were proven wrong.

In spite of the bad weather, our ship maintained its course, and on April 13th, we reached the Dardanelles in Turkey. By then the storm abated and we crossed the narrow passageway sailing towards the fortified city of Konstantinopol ",,"40.2000, 26.4000",Britannica,http://www.britannica.com/place/Dardanelles,,,,,
Konstantinopol,4/13/1901,,"The city is of enormous size and has very strong fortifications. They go back to the days when the Turks fought against the Russians (33). Konstantinopol became an international city with military garrisons of France, Britain and even Russia, making their presence felt there.

Again, we were being swamped by local merchants who arrived with all kinds of exotic fabrics for sale, such as hand-woven rugs, colorful kerchiefs, shawls, etc. We were already saturated with this kind of merchandise, yet it was always interesting and colorful to both watch and participate in the barter. We were at the time, running out of soap, especially the kind which we used for laundry. We were hoping that we'd be able to get it from the local merchants. We needed to do our last load of laundry before arriving in Russia. So, for the last time, the boat took on provisions, as we were about to enter the home waters of the Black Sea - on our way to our final destination - Odessa.

As rumor had it, though, we were to sail to Feodosiya instead of Odessa, our original destination. But, what difference does it make to us soldiers, as long as we were finally back in our homeland? At last, the end to this boat trip. In the meantime, one of the soldiers on board suddenly died. Unlike the officer before him, who was given almost royal burial, the soldier's body was going to be disposed of forthwith. Soldiers were a ""dime a dozen"", and the procedure for burial at sea was as follows: The body is bound with ropes to an iron rod, which, in turn, is put in a canvas bag and tucked in tightly. Then the bag is sewn tightly.	The ceremony is short and lasts only a few moments. Only a brief prayer is said. The body then glides off a wooden plank into the sea and the poor soul is allowed to ""learn how to swim."" However, he won't ""swim"" very long; soon the body will be attacked by sharks, who sniff the dead body out and proceed to have a royal feast.

Feodosiya,4/15/1901,4/15/1901,". April 15th at 2:00 in the afternoon we arrived and anchored near the city of Feodosiya. Our boat was to wait for a signal to enter the harbor as was customary for a boat bringing back home military troops. The signal came in the form of   three salvos from a cannon. When our ship got the message, she proceeded into the harbor and docked at the pier.

It was now 9:00 in the morning and a huge crowd was present to welcome us. An orchestra played and the orchestra aboard the ship played as well. There was big noise and commotion, which we haven't heard and or seen since we left Vladivostok. We were finally home!

A photographer came aboard and began to take pictures of us in various places on the boat so as to cover our return and show the boat which brought us back home. This took about an hour and gradually, the crowd on the dock began to disperse and the music subsided. We began to wonder what would happen next and when we would be allowed to disembark. 

While we were waiting for orders rumors began to spread about what might happen to us next. Some said that we'd probably have to undergo a thorough medical troops returning from the war. But what happened next was not exactly what the examination. Feodosiya was the military headquarters and assembly point for all rumors were all about. When our orders finally came to leave the boat we were extremely happy and thankful to the good Lord that he was no longer having us sail in the ""seven seas"" and that we were alive and well. 

First our belongings were put on wagons and we were taken of all places to the customs office for an inspection. Who would have expected that of all things, the first thing would be an examination of our belongings to see if we didn't bring in ""contraband"" from our foreign pursuits?

I personally had nothing of value or importance to declare nor did any of my fellow soldiers.	The whole thing was a real farce and we certainly weren't afraid of the consequences of the customs inspection. The inspection was finally over and we were taken to the bath- house. This was really a treat as we had not taken a real bath for ages. We were very happy with the turn of events after the customs inspection and all.

We felt like newborn babies, fresh and clean and really good about ourselves. We went back to the assembly point when the order was given and we all broke out in song as we were marching along. Our regimental orchestra went back into action and suddenly we felt like soldiers again, but of a happy sort. Not the kind of soldiers who go to war, but the kind that return from war, back to peace and life. At first we didn’t know where we were heading. We knew that Zhmerinka was our final destination, it was our home base, but how soon we'd be on our way there was still
Unknown to most of us soldiers.

At the assembly point, an orchestra was playing again and we were given food fit for a king. ""Fonie"" was generous and we were all fed as follows: white bread (it tasted like challa) and a big portion of halva (34) which we hadn't seen in ages.  To finish it off. We also each received a glass of vodka - a royal treat.

Finally, the time came for us to leave Feodosiya, which after all we had suffered through, gave us such a nice welcome. We were put on wagons with our gear, which was quite a luxury, and off to the railway station to board the train back to Zhmerinka, at last.

In all the commotion, while boarding the train, we noticed something unusual. A young Chinese boy, dressed in Russian military garb was being closely watched by an officer. As we found out earlier, the officer brought the boy from Manchuria as a ""trophy"", a memento of his adventures in a foreign land. The Russian soldiers followed him with their eyes in disbelief. Some threw coins at him, perhaps to see if he would dance. The more daring ones just   plain poked   fun at him and asked him to reveal his braid, which was neatly covered beneath his cap.

After this bit of ""fun and games"", we were assigned our seats on the train. The train was very crowded. And there were more of us than there were seats. We had to make the best of it in our assigned car.  Soon we began to sweat from the heat and crowded conditions. Our neat bath and fresh clothing were a thing of the past. A lengthy train trip was about to begin.

There were military and civilian people among the multitude. Friends and family came to see who returned from the war, in the hope of finding some of their own. We mingle with the people and they ask us many questions as they are very curious about our experiences. They asked us where we were corning from and where we were going and also did we know such and such a person.

Eventually, our socializing came to an abrupt end. An order and call for assembly came. We fell into line. The good news was that we were going to be fed and rumor had it that it would be a good supper, something that we hadn't had since the day we left Feodosiya.

Music played, and we were led marching like a ""kale zu der khupe (36)"" The crowd probably thought that we were led to perform an important duty, and deserved the biggest of honors.        We were fed a good, hot meal at the local army barracks. Soon after, we were led back to the train station to board our train and continue our journey.

At the train station, there was still a crowd, though somewhat smaller than before. People were still asking questions about our past experience. Some of us were tiring of answering the same questions. Many told of unheard stories of ""bravery"" and ""courage"" just to impress their listeners and thus to get rid of them. The people were left to mull over what they had been told.

Tired as we were by then we were grateful when the order came to return to our train compartment. It became dark suddenly and the crowd started to disperse.

Also, to our delight, we found out that Wapniarka was our last stop before Zhmerinka, our final and last stop - - end of our troubles and travels!

The latest news was like a dream come true. We'll finally return to our home base, but we dared not dream yet of our near homes, the places where we had our humble beginnings in the Czar's army. The place from which we started on our long and   hard campaign to Manchuria, half way across the world. With God's help, all this would be behind us, and we were returning from the war unharmed, something many of us didn't expect or believe would happen.

Even though we had no one in our train compartment who knew exactly where we were or how far we were from Zhrnerinka, we knew and sensed that we were quite near our destination.

Zhmerinka,4/20/1901,,"When we finally arrived in Zhmerinka, it was still raining; the rain came down by the bucketful. It was the middle of the night and the train station was flooded with light like daylight. In spite of the rain.  There was an orchestra present and a big crowd. The size of which we had not seen   before. It looked like the whole of Zhmerinka was there to welcome us. As soon as the train stopped, we were anxiously awaiting the order to get off the train and fall in line for a march back to our home base.

But our commanding officers didn't seem to be in a hurry. They must have had better accommodations on the train than we had, and probably weren't anxious to start marching in the pouring rain. The crowd outside found some protection underneath the extended roof of the small station and waited patiently. As if to answer our prayers, the rain suddenly abated. The orchestra started to play some cheerful marches and our officers finally ""got their act together"" and ordered us out of the train. Not only that, but we got a fifteen minute time off to mix with the crowd and find friends or relatives. The people in the crowd were as anxious to see us as we were to see them. Personally, I did not expect members of my family to come see me all the way from Warsaw. I was happy, though for I was getting physically closer to my real home, and the main thing was that I was alive and well. The reception we received was incredible. We were hugged and kissed by so many people we didn't know. Men were wiping their eyes with big handkerchiefs, women were sobbing aloud, unabashedly. Some of the soldiers found their relatives, and their joy was the greatest. The whole scene was bedlam - and for good reason.        How often does a trainload of soldiers arrive from the war? We had all been away a very long time and had experienced all kinds of hardships, not to mention the danger of being killed. The thought of those who hadn't returned alive, sort of flashed through my mind.  But, at the moment, the joy and happiness experienced by all overwhelmed that kind of thought.

Finally, after what seemed to be only a short reprieve, we were given our marching orders. We all fell in line, carrying our belongings on our backs, ready to return to our home barracks. As the music played ahead of us, and some of the crowd followed us, we marched back to the Zhmerinka home base. We trudged through the deep mud, after the rain. Wet and tired as we were with heavy loads on our backs (heavier due to being wet), we used our elation to help us overcome our fatigue. This made our steps lighter and our determination to reach our barracks even stronger.

Even though we were exhausted, we laughed on the inside and thanked the Lord for our good fortune. We had made it alive and returned home from a cruel war, and a possibly sad fate - back home to Russia and Zhmerinke. At last, in the distance, we could see the lights of the barracks beckoning to us and we felt like we were in Paradise!",Zhmerynka,"49.040396, 28.111535",Jewish Virtual Library,http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0021_0_21531.html,http://photos.wikimapia.org/p/00/02/53/86/28_big.jpg,,,,
